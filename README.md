# Welcome to Sabi

In response to Nintendo slapping Yuzu with a fat lawsuit, we're creating Sabi as a new open source emulation platform. The goal for Sabi is, quite honestly, utterly fucking insane. We're aiming to be able to emulate a variety of systems, and we'd like to build for cross-platform compatibility. With that being said, while our goals are extremely ambitious, we're going to start small with the Gameboy Color â€” objectively one of the easier platforms to emulate.

Reminder that emulation is legal and is morally correct.

We do not condone piracy.

## Why Sabi?

Sabi is a direct japanese translation for "rust", the language the emulator is built in. We thought it sounded cool, and we're terrible with names, so we're sticking with this.

## TODO

### CPU Emulation
Interpret and execute GBC opcode instructions.

### Memory management
Emulate the GBC's memory model, including ROM, RAM, and memory-mapped I/O.

### Graphics rendering
Draw the screen contents by emulating the GBC's pixel processing unit.

### Input handling
Capture and process user input as GBC button presses.

### Sound emulation
Replicate the GBC's sound synthesis.
