# Welcome to Sabi

In response to Nintendo slapping Yuzu with a fat lawsuit, we're creating Sabi as a new open source emulation platform. The goal for Sabi is, quite honestly, utterly fucking insane. We're aiming to be able to emulate a variety of systems, and we'd like to build for cross-platform compatibility. With that being said, while our goals are extremely ambitious, we're going to start small with the Gameboy â€” objectively one of the easier platforms to emulate.

Reminder that emulation is legal and is morally correct.

We do not condone piracy.

## Why Sabi?

Sabi is a direct japanese translation for "rust", the language the emulator is built in. We thought it sounded cool, and we're terrible with names, so we're sticking with this.

## A Warning To Any Lawyer (Especially Nintendo)

Hello, friendo.

![Hello, friendo.](image.png)

While we do genuinely appreciate your keen interest in trying to shut down emulation (for whatever reason), let us remind you of one thing. There is no law against emulation. However, there are laws against piracy. We do not condone piracy, we condone emulation.

Since there are no laws against emulation, this means that it's not explicitly illegal. By extension, this means it is fully legal.

With that in mind, here is our automatic response to every single motherfucker that wants to try to shut this project down:

![No](image-1.png)

"Oh but we're gonna take Novohort to court!!"

Lmfao.

![No](image-1.png)

"But you need to pay us millions of dollars!!"

Again, lmfao.

![No](image-1.png)

"But but but.."

Wanna read the paper again?

This project was inspired partly by the community-wide dissapointment (rage? sadness? idfk) felt by everyone after Yuzu and Citra were forced to shut down due to Nintendo's shenanigans.

But Novohort as an entity honestly doesn't give a fuck. We recognize that everybody will one day cease to exist, so none of this really matters. Tell us to shut down as much as you want. We simply will just... well, not.

## TODO

### CPU Emulation
Interpret and execute GB opcode instructions. Will need to implement a basic fetch-decode-execute cycle that can read and execute a simple set of instructions (e.g., NOP, LD, JP).

### Memory management
Emulate the GB's memory model, including ROM, RAM, and memory-mapped I/O. This will need a focus on ROM loading since we're gonna be loading `.gb` files, and basic read/write functions to memory addresses.

### Graphics rendering
Draw the screen contents by emulating the GB's pixel processing unit. The graphics system can be initially simple, just emulating the drawing of tiles and sprites to a frame buffer. May need to look into Rust graphics libraries such as `pixels` or `minifb` to display the contents of the frame buffer onto the screen.

### Input handling
Capture and process user input as GB button presses. Could use `winit` maybe to help with creating a window and handling input.

### Sound emulation
Eventually replicate the GB's sound synthesis. Look into using something like `cpal` to implement sound.
